# Self-Parking-Robot

Automatic parking is an autonomous car-maneuvering system that moves a vehicle from a traffic lane into a parking spot to perform parallel, perpendicular, or angle parking.

***Our Approach***

-Building a robot car model with autonomous parking capability to demonstrate our objectives. 

-Replicating the real-world vehicle parking scenarios when it comes to parking a vehicle in a parking slot.
